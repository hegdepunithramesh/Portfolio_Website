  <h3>🎮 Simon Game</h3>
  <p>A web-based memory game where a sequence of colors lights up, and you have to repeat it. The game starts by pressing any key (so currently accessible only via laptop/desktop). As you move forward, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.</p>

  <h3>🥁 Drum Kit</h3>
  <p>A musical drum kit you can play using your keyboard or mouse! Each key triggers a different drum sound, making it interactive and fun to play. Great way to feel like a drummer using just your keyboard.</p>
