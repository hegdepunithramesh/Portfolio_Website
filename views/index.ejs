<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>

<p>Hello! Iâ€™m an enthusiastic Information Science and Engineering (ISE) student with a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring how things work under the hoodâ€”whether itâ€™s a line of code, a data structure, or a full-stack web application. I believe in continuous learning and am passionate about building digital solutions that are both creative and meaningful.</p>

<p>
  This portfolio is a glimpse into my learning journey, projects, and skills. From developing responsive web interfaces to working with data and backend logic, Iâ€™ve enjoyed every step of bringing ideas to life through code. Feel free to explore my work, check out my projects, and connect with me as I continue growing in the world of tech..
