<h1>About Me</h1>
<img class="profile" src="images/ph.jpg" alt="My profile">

<p>
  I'm a passionate Information Science and Engineering (ISE) student with a strong interest in web development and backend technologies. I began my journey with C++, which helped me build a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. Over time, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills into full-stack development using technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and EJS.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also an active IEEE Member and currently volunteer with the IEEE SAC Bangalore Section, where I contribute to organizing events and technical workshops that help students grow. These experiences have shaped me into a collaborative, curious, and ever-evolving developer. I love turning ideas into real-world projects and am always looking to learn something new.
